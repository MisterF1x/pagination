# pagination

Pagination is a common user interface feature used in web applications to break
down large sets of data into smaller, more manageable chunks. My pagination
module, written in JavaScript, allows you to implement pagination functionality
in your web application.

When implemented, your pagination module will display a set of numbered links at
the bottom of a webpage, representing different pages of data. The user can then
click on one of these links to navigate to the corresponding page.

The basic functionality of pagination module is as follows:

- The module takes in a set of data, along with a specified number of items to
  display per page.
- It calculates the total number of pages required to display all the data,
  based on the specified items per page.
- It creates a set of numbered links, representing each page of data, and
  displays them at the bottom of the webpage.
- To customize the appearance of the pagination links, you would typically
  modify the CSS style rules in a separate style file associated with your web
  application.

Pagination module is a useful tool for implementing pagination functionality in
your web application, making it easier for users to navigate and manage large
sets of data.
